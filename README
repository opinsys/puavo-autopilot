This package can be used to simulate users.  It is integrated with
Puavo, Lightdm and mostly excepts Gnome-environment.  The autopilot
logs in from lightdm, and starts some programs and "uses" them.
Occasionally it will kill them and also log out.

The simulate user is adaptive to system performance: if system is more
responsive it is used more heavily, and if load gets higher user slows
down a bit.  This is to prevent users from completely trashing the system,
which would be easy, but unrealistic.

Puavo-autopilot can be used with thin clients, fat clients and laptops.
Fat clients and laptops are simpler cases.  If one or more puavo-tags
are found which are of the format "autopilot:$mode:$username:$password",
for example "autopilot:stress:heikki.hepuli:kukkuu", puavo-autopilot
will login through lightdm with username "heikki.hepuli" and password
"kukkuu".  There can be several autopilot tags, in which case one gets
chosen randomly for each login.

In desktop session, if $mode is "stress" and $username matches any
autopilot-tag, puavo-autopilot activates and starts doing stuff.
If username does not match, it does nothing.  This is to allow
users to login anyway and not have their session interfered
(puavo-autopilots waits some time in lightdm that this is usually
possible).

Some other modes than "stress" are planned to be used in the future.

In thin client and ltsp server case, thin clients behave like fatclients
and laptops at login stage.  However, as a desktop session starts, 
ltsp servers must also have corresponding tags set so that puavo-autopilot
activates on the desktop session.  This is to allow an ltsp server to be
used from other hosts (and with other logins) while other hosts function as
testing hosts.  One must add autopilot tags for every autopilot login to
ltspserver to test thin client desktop sessions with puavo-autopilot.

For example, presume we have hosts:

  test-fatclient-01
  test-laptop-01
  test-ltspserver-01
  test-thinclient-01
  test-thinclient-02

and logins:

  test-user-01 (with password "test1")
  test-user-02 (with password "test2")
  test-user-03 (with password "test3")
  test-user-04 (with password "test4")
  test-user-05 (with password "test5")

We want to configure

  "test-user-01"                    to "test-fatclient-01"
  "test-user-02" and "test-user-03" to "test-laptop-01"
  "test-user-04"                    to "test-thinclient-01"
				          and "test-ltspserver-01"
  "test-user-05"                    to "test-thinclient-02"
					  and "test-ltspserver-01"

The following tags will do this:

  test-fatclient-01:
    autopilot:stress:test-user-01:test1

  test-laptop-01:
    autopilot:stress:test-user-02:test2 autopilot:stress:test-user-03:test3

  test-ltspserver-01:
    autopilot:stress:test-user-04:test4 autopilot:stress:test-user-05:test5

  test-thinclient-01: 
    autopilot:stress:test-user-04:test4

  test-thinclient-02:
    autopilot:stress:test-user-05:test5
